The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the data has fully loaded. This is common when using asynchronous operations like `getDoc()` or `onSnapshot()`.  The error might not be explicitly a Firebase error, but rather a `TypeError` or `undefined` error. For instance, trying to access `snapshot.data().name` before the data is available in the snapshot results in an error.
